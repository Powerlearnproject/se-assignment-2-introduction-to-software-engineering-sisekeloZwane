# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
-This is a discipline of Engineering that is concerned with the entire process of developing high quality software

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
-Software Engineering is more structured and puts into consideration all aspects of software production to create reliable and efficient software within specified time and financial constraints while traditional programming is just concerned with just writing code.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
-a.Requirements; here we establish the services that are required from the software, we can categorize them into user requirements and system requirements
b.Design; creating detailed designs of the software architecture
c.Implementation;  here we bring our design into a program
d.Testing; check the software against the requirements that were drawn in the beggining
d. Deployment;rolling out the software to its users
e. Maintenance; provide support for software through out its lifecycle as well as improvements to adapt to ever changing requirements.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
-Agile methods follow an incremental approach with interleaved processes, the developing teams can work on more than one phase at a time which therefore in turn makes it easier to factor in change while Waterfall models use a plan driven approach with distinct phases which must be completed bereore moving onto the next,this makes it more tedious to adapt to changing requirements
-Agile models are more suited for small to medium sized projects, where the customer is fully committed to be part of the process
-Waterfall models are more suited for larger and complex projects such as Medical systems to ensure that every planned activity is done properly and progress is measured against the initial plan

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
-This the process of finding out the services that will be required from the software. 
a. Requirements Elicitation;here we find out about the application domain, services to be provided and the constraints the software will work under
b. Requirements Specification;the process of writing down requirements in a specification document
c. Requirements validation; checks that the requirements are really what the customer wants
d. Requirements management; this invloves mananging requirements as they change throughout the software's lifecycle

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
-Modularity refers to the separarion of major concerns in the software development process, it improves maintainability because changes can be effected to the specific module without affecting the entire system , also it easier to work with many smaller problems than one big problem

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
-Unit testing; we test individual system components
-Integration testing; here components are tested to see if they work togehter
-System testing; we intergrate components to create a version of the software
Acceptance testing; we test whether customers are ready to have th esoftware deployed to them
Testing is important because it validates whether the software meets the requirements and also checks to see unexpected behavior from the software's operations

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
-Version control systems are software tools used to track changes which are very beneficial for developers working in teams, for example git

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
